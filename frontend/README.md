## Deployment
This portfolio is ready to deploy on Vercel, Netlify, or any static hosting provider. Just make sure your media files are in the `public/Media/` directory and use lowercase, underscore-separated filenames (no spaces).

## Customization
- Add or edit projects in `pages/Project.jsx` and `pages/Projectvideos.jsx`.
- Place your images and videos in `public/Media/IMG/` and `public/Media/Videos/`.
- Update favicon in `public/` and reference it in `index.html`.

## Screenshots
Add screenshots of your portfolio here for a better preview.

## Troubleshooting
- If images or videos do not show up after deployment, ensure filenames are lowercase, use underscores, and match exactly in your code and the `public/Media/` folders.
- For best results, avoid spaces in filenames.
- If you update media, redeploy your site to reflect changes.
